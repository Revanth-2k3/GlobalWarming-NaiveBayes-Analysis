GlobalWarming-NaiveBayes-Analysis

Description:

This repository contains an implementation of a Naïve Bayes Classifier for analyzing and predicting climate-related trends using global warming data. The project uses a dataset with metrics such as:

Temperature Anomalies

CO2 Emissions

Renewable Energy Usage

Methane Emissions

Forest Area

GDP

Population

Sea Level Rise

Air Pollution Index, and more.

The project aims to demonstrate how machine learning can be applied to environmental data to uncover trends and insights into global climate patterns.

Features:

Data preprocessing using Python libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn.

Implementation of Gaussian Naïve Bayes for classification tasks.

Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as accuracy score and classification report.

Insights into the relationships between environmental factors and climate change indicators.

Requirements:

The project requires the following dependencies:

Python 3.7+

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive analysis)

Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is named global_warming_dataset.csv. It contains historical data on various climate-related metrics across different countries and years. Ensure the dataset is placed in the appropriate directory before running the code.

Results:

The results include an evaluation of the classifier's accuracy and insights derived from the dataset.

Example outputs include classification reports, accuracy scores, and visualizations of climate trends.
